I have now completed a year of journaling. I first started journaling after reading some books on writing. I wanted to learn more about the process. Writing seems so complex. It also seems like just thoughts, pen, and paper. If that much. 
<br /><br />
This year I am looking for another new year's project to add to my life. I have given it some thought. There are a lot of programming projects I have wanted to complete for years now. So, I want to focus on those. It's difficult putting yourself out there. Perhaps it's best to just jump in.

This website is one of the faded to-do list items of mine. Mostly because I wasn't sure with what to fill the pages. What could possibly be so interesting to fill up this site? Does it need to be intersting? There are enough boring corners of the internet. What's the problem with one more? Low expectations makes it easier to just jump in.
